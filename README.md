### then while in mockAPI folder, use `json-server --watch mock.json --port 3001` command to run API in http://localhost:3001
### finally open a separate terminal and use `npm start` command to run the app in the development mode.

To see flight data, use Adana Havalimanı as the departure airport, Sabiha Gökçen Havalimanı as the arrival airport and 20/01/2024 as both the departure date and arrival date.
Similar JSON data is available in the mock.json file inside the mockAPI folder. You can add or edit any data as long as its structure is the same.
